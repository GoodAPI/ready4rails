Is this gem ready for Rails X?
==============================

**NOTE:** Currently, we only support Rails 4.

[Ready4Rails.net][website] lists many gems and shows whether they are ready
for last versions of Rails or not. You can also paste your Gemfile to get
a one-click report of the status of your Gemfile gems.

Thanks to
---------

* all the people who reports new gem status and add new gems to the site.
* [Amar Raja][amarraja] for allowing the users to paste their Gemfiles.
